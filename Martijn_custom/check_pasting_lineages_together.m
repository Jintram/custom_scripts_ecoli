% Plot of length of linaege, were there is a factor PI_{div ratio}
% -- or perhaps better accumulate the the birth lengths of non-tracked
% daughters



% Make an exponential (running window) fit to that plot of normalized lengths


% Compare this to the current mu paramter that we have per schnitzcells 
% 

% TODO ===
% Think about whether daughters are expected to inherit growth rate of
% their parents or not. (In principle I think yes, since rate limiting 
% concentrations are on scales much smaller than cell volume and will thus
% get divided equally between two daughter cells.)

% This script calculate corr or cov values for a cloud.

% Note that Noreen has sent me two websites with two nice explanations when
% the slope indeed is the same as the cov, and when not.

fi = 1; % figure index

%% Simple linear relationsship
% ===
x = [0:.01:1];
y = 5*x+2;
figure(fi); clf; plot(x,y);
Rlin = corr(x',y')
%corrcoef(x',y')
fi = fi+1;

%% The outcome of this is one, which can be derived easily,
% see notes 19-04-2015 (p. 2). A manual calculation of the R is as follows:
% ===
% Note:
% corr(x(t),y(t)) = 
varXY = 0; varX = 0; varY = 0;
xNorm = x-mean(x);
yNorm = y-mean(y);
N = numel(x);
for t=1:N
    % sum
    varXY = (varXY + xNorm(t)*yNorm(t));
    varX  = (varX+xNorm(t)^2);
    varY  = (varY+yNorm(t)^2);
end
% normalize
varXY = varXY; varX = varX; varY = varY;
% correlation coefficient
RXY = varXY / sqrt(varX*varY)

% Note that you can calculate the correlation coefficients easily:
betaY = varXY / varX
betaX = varXY / varY
% Note furthermore that these relations are derived by wanting to find the
% minimum of the sum of squared errors; this can be done by looking for the
% derivative being zero. Above relations then follow. See also:
% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares
% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_involving_ordinary_least_squares#Least_squares_estimator_for_.CE.B2
% (And this was also mentioned in my programming course - see lecture notes 
% thereof.)

%% What happens if you have a non-linear relation?
% E.g. a parabola
% ===
x = [-1:.01:1];
y = -1*x.^2;
figure(fi); clf; plot(x,y);
Rpara = corr(x',y')
fi = fi+1;

% % Rpara =
% %  3.1614e-18
% So apparently the correlation disappears completely for a parabola.
% Which makes sense since there is no straight line describing this 
% relationship.

%% Another example
% ===
x = [-1:.01:1];
y = 4*x.^3+x.^4;
figure(fi); clf; plot(x,y);
Rarbi = corr(x',y')
fi = fi+1;

% DJK_divide_branch_data divides branch data in seperate groups, each
% originating from the same parent cell. 
% Modification wrt to DJK_tim_branch_data: branches are trimmed to a
% certain initiation time "inittime".
% All branches which have the same parent cell from "DJK_trim_branchData"
% will appear in the same branchgroup. Even if inittime restricts these
% branches to a shorter time window where there is no parentschnitz in
% common.
%
% returns a collection of branches (a struct of structs)

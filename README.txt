IMPORTANT NOTE
===
Note that this structure allows changing each other's file on the repo. When you pull, and other people have edited your files, they might be overwritten (if comitted, reversibly, however). So be carefull with editing other people's files. Always do this in a separate branch, and deliberate with person in question when merging into the master.

INTRODUCTION
===

This directory contains Schnitzcells code that is not necessarily convenient for other people, but is convenient as reference to put online, so other people can have a look.

FILE STRUCTURE
===

I propose the following naming convention:
<yourname>_extensions:      files that are a general extension of the code but in a very experimental stage. 
<yourname>_custom:          scripts that are necessary for your own research, and are probably not directly usefull for other people. 
<yourname>_libs:            files that are not directly related to Schnitzcells, e.g. scripts that are in general convenient for plotting.

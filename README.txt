INTRODUCTION
===

This directory contains Schnitzcells code that is not necessarily convenient for other people, but is convenient as reference to put online, so other people can have a look.

FILE STRUCTURE
===

I propose the following naming convention:
<yourname>_extensions:      files that are a general extension of the code but in a very experimental stage. 
<yourname>_custom:          scripts that are necessary for your own research, and are probably not directly usefull for other people. 
<yourname>_libs:            files that are not directly related to Schnitzcells, e.g. scripts that are in general convenient for plotting.

TODOS
